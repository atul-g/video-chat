# Notes

### Initial Setup

1. Created separate directories for frontend and backend.
2. Frontend part was created using, `npx create frontend`.
3. For backend, I just created the folder backend, and ran a `npm init` inside
    it.
4. I deleted any .git directories that were present, (create-react-app creates
    one )

### Backend
1. "/:<name>" - the "name" in the route should not have hypends in it. For
    example, ":/meet-id", will not work as a route.
